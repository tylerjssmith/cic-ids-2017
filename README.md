# Network Intrusion Detection with CIC-IDS-2017

## Overview
This project builds machine learning models for network intrusion detection. The training data consist of network flows generated by the [Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity](https://www.unb.ca/cic) for the CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark dataset (see [data/README.md](data/README.md) for details). The models classify network flows as normal/benign or one or more types of attacks.

## Getting Started
The package trains, tests, and finalizes models following configuration files (see [config/](config/)).

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/tylerjssmith/cic-ids-2017.git

# Enter repo
cd cic-ids-2017

# If necessary, create environment and install requirements.
# > conda create --name cic-ids-2017 python
# > conda activate cic-ids-2017
# > pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download raw data to data/raw/.
# See data/README.md

# Train binary classifier of denial of service (DoS) attacks.
bash scripts/train_models.sh config/train_dos_binary.yml
```

## Binary: Denial of Service Attacks
We explore binary classification of denial of service attacks in a [Jupyter notebook](notebooks/dos_denial_of_service.ipynb). We compared performance of logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting (XGBoost) on 54 and 10 features, obtaining comparable performance with the feature subset. The final model was an XGBoost model trained on the subset ([dos_binary_final_sub.skops](models/dos_binary_final_sub.skops)).
