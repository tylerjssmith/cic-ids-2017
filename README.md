# Network Intrusion Detection System

## Machine Learning with CIC-IDS-2017

### Overview
This project builds machine learning models for network intrusion detection. The training data consist of network flows generated by the [Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity](https://www.unb.ca/cic) for the CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark dataset (see [data/README.md](data/README.md) for details).

### Getting Started
The code follows configuration files, which train and test models to classify network flows as normal/benign or one or more types of attacks. In `config/`, there are `*_train.yml`, `*_test.yml`, and `*_final.yml` files for different types of attacks. No changes to the code should be necessary. 

```bash

```

### Binary Classifier: Denial of Service Attacks
We explore classification of denial of service attacks in a [Jupyter notebook](`notebooks/dos_denial_of_service.ipynb`). Based on our exploration, we have developed `dos_train.yml`, `dos_test.yml`, and `dos_final.yml` to build a binary classifier for denial of service attacks (see above). We compared performance of logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting (XGBoost). The final XGBoost model is available [here](models/dos_binary.skops).
